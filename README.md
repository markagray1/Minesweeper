# Minesweeper

This project is a classic implementation of the Minesweeper game, where players uncover squares on a grid to find and avoid hidden mines. The game provides an engaging challenge and requires strategic thinking to reveal all non-mine cells without triggering any mines.

## Features

- **Grid Layout**: A customizable grid of cells, with a specified number of mines.
- **Cell Reveal**: Uncover cells to reveal either a number indicating adjacent mines or a blank space.
- **Mine Placement**: Random placement of mines on the grid.
- **Win/Loss Detection**: Determine the game's outcome based on the player's actions.
- **Recursion (In Progress)**: Automatic uncovering of adjacent cells when stepping on a cell with zero adjacent mines. (Note: This feature is still in development and needs to be added.)
